# *Foodle*

## The Project
Nowadays, communication and planning are managed through social media. Social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) are platforms used to easily distribute and receive news and articles. A high percentage of news distributed in these platforms contains generic or irrelevant information, especially if you're a foodie or just looking for a good bite to eat.

The project we're working on is a mobile application that solves this problem by merging food news and social media interaction. The application is called 'Foodle'. Foodle is an Android-based mobile application that focuses on the distribution of food news with the aim of creating a localised eating guide and facilitating communication between users through shared interests and preferences.

## Concept
The idea of this project is to provide people with a medium to share and keep up to date with news that's strictly food-related and to connect people through their love of food. So whether you're just looking for a decent restaurant that's nearby or if you just want share your thoughts on a cafe, Foodle is the one-stop foodie platform for you.

Users will have a news feed that's tailored to their cuisine preferences by selecting their preferred cuisines, as well as tracking their likes and dislikes, they can also choose to opt out of this if they like to try new things. Users can also choose to connect Foodle with their Facebook accounts to transfer over any food-related data for a more personalised experience on Foodle. All the news that's displayed on their screens will be localised by tracking their location, this gives them food-related news and information that suits the location they're in. When searching for a place to eat, the application will alert them to any nearby eateries. Users will also be able to rate eateries and post reviews or photographs of their experience on their news feed. Users will be able to send out private notifications to friends to set up dates or meet ups with them at a specific eatery, to which their friends can reply with a short response. 

## Target Audience
Foodle’s primary audience are food lovers of all ages who live in the same locality and share similar interests in food. However, the application can also be used by people who just want to find a decent eatery that’s close by. 

Bailey 21 yr old - identifies as male
Primarily uses his Samsung Galaxy S7 to regularly browse the Internet with Google Chrome. Currently completing in his third year of university. Bailey is unemployed and therefore on a budget. He is searching for an affordable eatery with decent reviews, so he is browsing the Foodle application for food nearby. He finds a local cafe near his college that has decent reviews and serves meals within his price range, so he decides to check it out. He thoroughly enjoys his meal and decides to share the aesthetic photo he took of his meal along with a glowing review, on Foodle.  

Beatrice 76 yr old - identifies as female
Owns an Oppo F1 and likes to Google search for decent cafes. She is looking to take an old friend out for afternoon tea but wants to go somewhere new. She decides to download the Foodle application to find a suitable cafe. The Foodle application asks her to select her favourite cuisine to tailor her news feed to her liking. After completing this step, the app gives her recommendations based on her cuisine selections and her location. She finds a trendy new cafe that had just opened up within a short driving distance of her retirement village. She heads over with her friend and they order the special of the day. She thought the food was alright, it was not anything special in her eyes but it was satisfying. She opens her Foodle app and leaves a three star rating with no image or review.
