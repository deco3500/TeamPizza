# Summary
Nowadays, communication and planning are managed through social media. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter are used to easily distribute and receive news and articles. A high percentage of news distributed in these platforms contains generic or irrelevant information, especially if you are a foodie or just looking for a good bite to eat. 

Foodle is a new and innovative mobile application that combines food news and social media. By focusing on providing a localised and personalised eating guide, users can conveniently discover amazing restaurants in their area and send instant invitations to their friends. In addition, users can keep up to date with food news through the integrated news feed, featuring articles as well as images and reviews posted by their friends. Users also have the option to swipe between news feeds to see just articles, or just posts from their friends. With all these features wrapped up in one application, users have the ultimate eating guide at their fingertips.
