# *Introduction:*

## The Project

Nowadays, communication and planning is managed through social media. Social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc) are platforms used to easily distribute and receive news and articles. A high percentage of news distributed in these platforms contain generic or irrelevant information.

The project is focused in the distribution of food news through social media with the aim of creating an eating guide visible for all users around the area. The purpose of the project is to develop mobile (Android) based application that allows people to search and share food news, as well as share posts and photographs about eateries they’ve been to and meals they’ve had. 

Concept: outline the idea and the rationale behind it. Define the project aims and audience and identify how your idea is different from / improves upon other current offerings.

## Concept

* “FOODLE will connect people with food and friends, wherever they are and whenever”
* Merges food news and social media
* User’s location is tracked so they get local food news - shows new cafes around Brisbane if the user lives in Brisbane
* Their newsfeed is tailored to suit their likes and dislikes
* Alerts them to convenient and delicious eateries nearby

## Aims
* Increase social interaction
* Increase awareness of food hotspots
* Filter restaurants information depending on user feedback using a rate system
* Provide a one-stop platform for people to find food related information
* Allow easy access for food information using mobile technologies like GPS etc.
* Provide localised food-related news/information

## Context
(Target users/audience and context of use clearly defined and project is creatively aligned to them)

Foodle’s primary audience are food lovers of all ages who live in the same locality and share similar interests in food. However, the application can also be used by people who just want to find a decent eatery that’s closeby. 

Bailey 21 yr old - identifies as male
Primarily uses his Samusung Galaxy S7 to regularly browse the internet with Google Chrome. Currently completing in his third year of university. Bailey is unemployed and therefore on a budget. He is searching for an affordable eatery with decent reviews, so he is browsing the Foodle application for food nearby. He finds a local cafe near his college that has decent reviews and serves meals within his price range, so he decides to check it out. He thoroughly enjoys his meal and decides to share the aesthetic photo he took of his meal along with a glowing review, on Foodle.  

Beatrice 76 yr old - identifies as female
Owns an Oppo F1 and likes to Google search for decent cafes. She is looking to take an old friend out for afternoon tea but wants to go somewhere new. She decides to download the Foodle application to find a suitable cafe. The Foodle application asks her to select her favouite cuisine to tailor her newsfeed to her liking. After completing this step, the app gives her recommendations based on her cuisine selections and her location. She finds a trendy new cafe that had just opened up within a short driving distance of her retirement village. She heads over with her friend and they order the special of the day. She thought the food was alright, it was not anything special in her eyes but it was satisfying. She opens her Foodle app and leaves a three star rating with no image or review.
