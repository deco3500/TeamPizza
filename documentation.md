## Testing Session 1 (Ellen)
### Search page
* ‘Refine Search’ wasn’t obvious, user was unaware of the functionality of the button
  * Solution: Have it at the bottom of the page with a button that says refine search or an icon

### Restaurant details
* User suggested to include a ‘leave a review’ button as well as a ‘see user reviews’
  * Solution: include buttons to view user reviews and to leave a review
