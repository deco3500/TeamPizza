# Preliminary Research
UI and UX designs from similar applications


In order to provide an optimal user experience it was necessary to analyse similar applications to the Foodle concept. The aim is to compare apps and find common features that allow users to easily browse and communicate with their friends on one platform.

This document focuses on analysing the common, successful features of three food related mobile applications: BigOven, Yummly, Urban Spoon and Yelp. The features of these highly rated applications will help to shape the functionality of Foodle. 


### BigOven:

Overview: BigOven is an Android/IOS based application that allow users to create, search and share food recipes to their friends.
It uses a simple image based approach to display content. Popular searches or recipes shared by friends are displayed on the Main page (Figure 1). All application pages are linked in the menu bar (at the top of the page). Figure 2, shows the user profile page. It contains recipes created and shared by the user. User are able to track others by “following” them.

Analysis:
Main Page (Figure 1): Recipes are displayed in a list as large images with titles. For quick and easy browsing, a search tool is implemented at the top of the screen. Also the user can browse through the entire app by using the top menu bar.

User Profile (Figure 2): At the top of the screen, follower count is indicated, as well as the number of recipes uploaded by the user. The recipes shared by the user (owner) are displayed as a list with medium sized images. Below each image a star rating system is implemented, users can rate recipes from lowest (1) to highest (5).


### Yummly Recipes & Shopping List

Overview: Yummly, an Android/IOS based application focused on personalised searches, helps users to collect, save and manage their favourite recipes. The user can select recipes based on nutritional value (calories, fats, etc.) and time and technique required to complete the recipe. Users are also able to rate and review others’ recipes.

Analysis:
As shown in Figure 3, Yummly features a filtered search tool that allow users to refine their searches (salty, bitter, sour, etc.), to customise results. 

Figure 4, shows the user rating and review section. Users of Yummly can rate and comment recipes shared by friends. The recipe rating - 1 to 5 stars, shown at the top of the screen - is dependant on these reviews. 

### Zomato

### Yelp

### Comparison and Conclusions

* Standard rate system using stars à Spoons
* Check how useful was the article from that particular restaurant.
* Search Bar to search for restaurants outside the user’s location.
* Avoid continuous transition through pages (frames)
* Maybe rate the service and food too (more detailed rating system).
 
Social Interaction:
* Reward users depending of their contribution to the rest of users. Similar to “Yahoo Answers”.
* Leaderboard to encourage people to share more content.
* Other users not from the “friend list” are able to rate the information shared by the user. Increase interaction and make it less boring.
* Meeting feature: Users able to set up meeting point (“create event on fb”) friends need to confirm attendance.
* If user approves location tracking à create feature that allow the users to show their location on their friends map. Similar to Apple app “find friends”. Check if friends are in the zone and facilitate last minute meetings.

## Usability Testing
### User 1
#### Search page
‘Refine Search’ wasn’t obvious, user was unaware of the functionality of the button.
* Solution: Have it at the bottom of the page with a button that says refine search or an icon.

#### Restaurant details
User suggested to include a ‘leave a review’ button as well as a ‘see user reviews’.
* Solution: include buttons to view user reviews and to leave a review.

#### Newsfeed
User thought that the newfeed looked bland with just article titles and blurbs. The user suggested using images in the article previews to make them look more appealing.

### User 2
#### Main Menu page
User thought that having the main menu in a seperate page was old fashioned and suggested that we have a menu/navigation bar with only a few links in them.

#### Search page
User couldn't find 'refine search' option. User didn't think that the symbol meant anything, thought it was a decoration. User suggested having it right below the search bar with a more universally accepted/understood icon or just have it say 'refine search'.

#### Overall thoughts
User thought that the application could benefit from some colours and proper pictures to have a more complete look.

### User 3
#### Log In/Landing page
User suggested having a little blurb as to what the application is about on the front page and maybe some explanation or pictures as to what functions the application has.

#### Newsfeed 
User thought the newsfeed page needed a filter for posts from friends and a filter for news only. User got the idea from Facebook.

#### Overall thoughts
Application seemed pretty straightforward to the user. User thought that navigation was quite intuitive other than the flaws mentioned above. 

## Mockups
Based on the usability testing results above, mockups were made with the users' critiques put into consideration.

Changes made: 
* Main menu page has been removed and placed into menu/navigation bars at the bottom of the screen which will be present on every page
* Images added to the background of the articles
* Users have the option to read other user reviews on the restaurant details page

Interactive wireframes were made on Marvel App.
