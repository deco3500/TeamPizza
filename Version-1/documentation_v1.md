## Testing Session
### User 1
#### Search page
* ‘Refine Search’ wasn’t obvious, user was unaware of the functionality of the button
  * Solution: Have it at the bottom of the page with a button that says refine search or an icon

#### Restaurant details
* User suggested to include a ‘leave a review’ button as well as a ‘see user reviews’
  * Solution: include buttons to view user reviews and to leave a review

#### Newsfeed
* User suggested using images in the article previews to make them look more appealing.

#### Analysis
User was able to carry out tasks quite easily and navigation seemed intuitive.
