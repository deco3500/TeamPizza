## Usability Testing
### User 1
#### Search page
‘Refine Search’ wasn’t obvious, user was unaware of the functionality of the button.
* Solution: Have it at the bottom of the page with a button that says refine search or an icon.

#### Restaurant details
User suggested to include a ‘leave a review’ button as well as a ‘see user reviews’.
* Solution: include buttons to view user reviews and to leave a review.

#### Newsfeed
User thought that the newfeed looked bland with just article titles and blurbs. The user suggested using images in the article previews to make them look more appealing.

### User 2
#### Main Menu page
User thought that having the main menu in a seperate page was old fashioned and suggested that we have a menu/navigation bar with only a few links in them.

#### Search page
User couldn't find 'refine search' option. User didn't think that the symbol meant anything, thought it was a decoration. User suggested having it right below the search bar with a more universally accepted/understood icon or just have it say 'refine search'.

#### Overall thoughts
User thought that the application could benefit from some colours and proper pictures to have a more complete look.

### User 3
#### Log In/Landing page
User suggested having a little blurb as to what the application is about on the front page and maybe some explanation or pictures as to what functions the application has.

#### Newsfeed 
User thought the newsfeed page needed a filter for posts from friends and a filter for news only. User got the idea from Facebook.

#### Overall thoughts
Application seemed pretty straightforward to the user. User thought that navigation was quite intuitive other than the flaws mentioned above.
